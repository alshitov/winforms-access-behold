## Feel free to use these while building your C# WinForms applications
### This app was build while preparing one of my university projects. The code is not ideal and I'm not pretending to :]

The main problem I faced while working on the app is that Microsoft OleDb Provider does not allow you to fetch information
of stored procedures as it is supposed to be. Because of that I was forced to parse them with regular expressions, which
time to time causes unexpected bugs.

## Below you can find several shots of app in action.
